### Project 1: Semantic_Therapist

Description: Generate therapist reports with this tool, which takes user input to conduct semantic searches through the LiveLongerData.csv. By pinpointing the top 5 factors most relevant to your input, it lays the groundwork for a tailored guidance report. The final report is crafted by ChatGPT-4 to provide you with actionable steps and personalized advice.
